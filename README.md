# Next Best Action Reasoner

This prototype results out of a thesis for generating a framework to suggest the next best action in insurance claim management.


The project consists out of the main framework [nba-reasoner](/nba-reasoner) and two sample projects ([nba-simple-insurance](/nba-simple-insurance), [nba-tic-tac-toe](/nba-tic-tac-toe)) using the framework to suggest next best actions.
